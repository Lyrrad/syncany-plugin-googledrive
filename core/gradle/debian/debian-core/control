Description: Secure file sync software for arbitrary storage backends
 Syncany allows users to backup and share certain folders of their workstations
 using any kind of storage. Syncany is open-source and provides data encryption
 and incredible flexibility in terms of storage type and provider:
 .
  - Data encryption: Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online 
    storage can be used even for sensitive data.
 .
  - Arbitrary storage: Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can be
    used with any type of remote storage.
