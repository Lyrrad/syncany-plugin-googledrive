NAME
  sy-status - list new and changed files in local Syncany folder
    
SYNOPSIS
  sy status [-f | --force-checksum] 
  
DESCRIPTION 
  This command compares the local file tree on the disk with the local
  database and detects local changes. These changes are printed to the
  console.
  
  Local changes are detected using the last modified date and the file size
  of a file. If they match the local database, the command assumes that the
  content has not changed (no checksum comparison). If -f is enabled, the 
  checksum is additionally compared.
  
  This command is used by the 'up' command to detect local changes.  
  
OPTIONS
  -f, --force-checksum
    Enforces this command to compare files by checksum, not by file size
    and last modified date only. This option is particularly useful if
    files are modified in-place very often (last modified date and size 
    do not change). For large local folders, this option can tremendously
    decrease the performance of this command and increase I/O significantly.
