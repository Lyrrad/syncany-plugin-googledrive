NAME
  sy-restore - restore old or deleted files
   
SYNOPSIS
  sy restore [-r | --revision=<revision>] [-t | --target=<filename>]
             <file-identifier>
  
DESCRIPTION 
  This command restores old or deleted files from the remote storage.
  
  As long as a file is known to the local database and the corresponding
  chunks are available on the remote storage, it can be restored using this
  command. The command downloads the required chunks and assembles the file.
  
  If no target revision is given with -r, the last version is restored. To 
  select a revision to restore, the `sy ls` command can be used.   
  
OPTIONS
  -r, --revision=<revision>
    Selects a certain revision/version to restore. If no revision is given,
    the last revision is used.
  
  -t, --target=<file>            
    Defines the target output filename to restore the file to. If this option 
    is not given, the default filename is the filename of the restored file
    version, appended with a "restored" suffix. All folders given in the
    target filename will be created.
    
  <file-identifier>
   Identifier of the file history as printed by the `sy ls` command. The 
   file identifier and a revision/version number uniquely identify a single
   version of a file at a certain point in time. The identifier can be 
   abbreviated if it is unique in the database.   
   
EXAMPLES   
  sy restore 3168ab663e
    Restores the last version of the file with identifier 3168ab663e. If the
    database knows three versions of this file, the second file will be
    restored. Assuming that the original filename was 'folder/file.txt', the
    target filename will be 'folder/file (restored).txt'. If 'folder' does not
    exist, it will be created.
    
  sy restore --revision=1 --target=restored-file.txt 3168ab663e
    Restores version 1 of the file with the identifier 3168ab663e to the 
    target file 'restored-file.txt'. If this file exists, an error will be
    thrown.
