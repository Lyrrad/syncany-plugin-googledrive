NAME
  sy-cleanup - remove old versions and free remote disk space  
 
SYNOPSIS
  sy cleanup [-o | --delete-older-than=<relative-time>] [-f | --force]
             [-I | --no-delete-interval] [-O | --no-delete-older-than]
             [-T | --no-temp-removal] [<status-options>]
            
DESCRIPTION 
  This command performs different operations to cleanup the local database as 
  well as the remote store. It removes old versions from the local database,
  deletes unused multichunks (if possible) and merges remote database files, 
  if necessary.
  
  Remove old file versions: File versions are deleted by two criteria. The
  first is if it is older than 30 days (configurable with -o, disable with -O). 
  The second is an interval based strategy, to keep the version history 
  readable. By default, one version is kept per minute in the last hour,
  one verison is kept per hour in the last three days and one version
  per day is kept in the last month. This strategy can be disabled with -I. 
  
  Merge remote databases: The remote databases of the local client are merged 
  together if there are more than 15 remote databases per client. The purpose 
  of this is to avoid endless amounts of small database files on the remote 
  storage and a quicker download process for new clients. In addition, 
  databases are merged whenever versions are removed.
  
  This command uses the 'status' and 'ls-remote' commands and is only executed
  if there are neither local nor remote changes.
  
OPTIONS
  -o, --delete-older-than=<relative-time>
    Sets the time that cleanup waits before deleting all versions that are 
    older than this time. Until this time, deleted files can still be restored. 
    Cleanup will fully delete files that were deleted longer ago in the past
    than this amount of time and they will be gone permanently. In addition,
    any versions of files which are not the current version, and older than
    this threshold will also be deleted.
    Default is 30 days (30d).
    
    Relative time format: <value><unit>, for which <value> may be any 
    floating point number and <unit> may be any of the following: s(econds),
    m(inutes), h(ours), d(ays), w(eeks), mo(nths), y(ears). Units may be
    shortened if they are unique. Examples: 5h30m or 1y1mo2d
  
  -I, --no-delete-interval
    Turns off the version removal strategy based on intervals. 
    By default the following policy is applied:
    For the last hour,        the last version from each minute is kept.
    For the last three days,  the last version from each hour   is kept.
    For the last thirty days, the last version from each day    is kept.
    
    With this option, only old file versions (-o) will be deleted. 
    
  -O, --no-delete-older-than 
    Turns off the removal of old versions for the command. If this is set, this
    command will not delete file versions purely because they are old. 
    
  -T, --no-temp-removal   
    Turns off the removal of leftover temporary files for the command. If this
    is set, this command will leave temporary files on the offsite storage
    untouched.   
    
  -f, --force
    Forces a the cleanup, even if the time between cleanups (3 hours) has not 
    passed. Use this option only if a cleanup is absolutely necessary and you
    know what you are doing.
