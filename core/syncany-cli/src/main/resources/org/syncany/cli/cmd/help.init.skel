NAME
  sy-init - intialize local directory and create remote Syncany repository

SYNOPSIS
  sy init [-P | --plugin=<plugin>] [-o | --plugin-option=<key=value>]
          [-E | --no-encryption] [-G | --no-compression] [-s | --short]
          [-t | --create-target] [-a | --advanced] [-n | --add-daemon]
          [--password]

DESCRIPTION
  This command creates a new remote repository using the specified plugin, and
  initializes the local directory. Unless -o is set, the command is
  interactive and queries the user for input.

  Depending on the chosen plugin chosen (with -P or interactively), different
  plugin-specific options are required or optional.

  Once the 'init' command was successfully executed, the initialized local
  folder can be synced with the newly created repository. The commands
  'up', 'down', 'watch', etc. can be used. Other clients can then be connected
  using the 'connect' command.

OPTIONS
  -P, --plugin=<plugin>
    Selects a plugin to use for the repository. Local files will be synced via
    the storage specified by this plugin. Any of the following available
    plugins can be used: %PLUGINS%

  -o, --plugin-option=<key=value> (multiple options possible)
    Sets a plugin-specific setting in the form of a key/value pair. Each
    plugin defines different mandatory and optional settings. At least, all
    mandatory settings must be specified by this option. All mandatory and
    optional settings can be listed using the 'plugin' command.

  -E, --no-encryption
    DO NOT USE THIS OPTION. Turns off the encryption for the newly created
    remote repository. All files are stored in plaintext. No password is
    needed for either syncany:// link, multichunk or metadata.

  -G, --no-compression
    Turns off Gzip compression for the newly created remote repository. All
    files are stored in uncompressed form. Can increase indexing performance,
    but will also increase transfer times and remote storage space.

  -t, --create-target
    If not existent, creates the target path on the remote storage. If this
    option is not given, the command will fail if the target folder/path does
    not exist.

  -a, --advanced
    Runs the interactive setup in an advanced mode, querying the user for more
    detailed encryption options. In particular, it is possible to select the
    available symmetric ciphers and modes of operation to encrypt the
    repository with.

  -n, --add-daemon
    The initialized local folder is automatically added to the daemon
    configuration for automatic synchronization if this option is used.
    
  -s, --short
    The syncany:// link printed after the initialization will be shortened
    using the Syncany link shortener service. This option stores the encrypted
    link on the Syncany servers. The option does not work if -E is enabled.

  --password=<password>
    DO NOT USE THIS OPTION. Set the password used to encrypt the repository.
    This option shouldn't be used, because the password might be visible to 
    other users or be stored in history files.
