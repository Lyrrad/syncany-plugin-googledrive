NAME 
  sy-watch - monitor local Syncany folder and automatically sync changes
  
SYNOPSIS
  sy watch [-i | --interval=<sec>] [-s | --delay=<sec>] [-W | --no-watcher]
           [-a | --announce=<host>:<port>] [-N | --no-announcements]
           [<status-options> | <up-options> | <down-options>]
  
DESCRIPTION 
  Automatically synchronizes the local folder with the repository. The
  command performs the up and down command in an interval, watches the
  file system for changes and subscribes to the Syncany pub/sub server. 
  
  In the default configuration (no options), the command subscribes to the
  Syncany pub/sub server and registers local file system watches in the 
  locally synced folder (and all of its subfolders). When local events are
  registered, the command waits a few seconds (waiting for settlement) and 
  then triggers the 'up' command. After the upload has finished, a message
  is published to the pub/sub server, telling other clients of this repo
  that there is new data. Clients subscribed to the repository's channel 
  will receive this notification and immediately perform a 'down' command.
  This mechanism allows instant synchronization among clients even if a dumb
  storage server (such as FTP) is used.
  
  In case file system events or pub/sub notifications are missed, the 
  periodic synchronization using the 'down' and 'up' command is implemented
  as a fallback.
  
  Note: The messages exchanged through the pub/sub server do not include any
  confidential data. They only include the repository identifier (randomly 
  generated in the 'init' phase), and a client identifier (randomly generated
  on every restart).   
  
OPTIONS    
  -s, --delay=<sec>                
    Waits for <sec> seconds for file system watcher to settle before starting
    to index newly added files. If many file system actions are executed (e.g.
    copying a large folder), waiting a few seconds ensures that actions
    belonging together are uploaded in a single new database version. 
    Default value is 3 seconds.
    
  -W, --no-watcher                 
    Disables folder watcher entirely. Local changes in the synced folder (and 
    its subfolders) will not be registered right away. Instead, local changes 
    will only be detected by the periodic synchronization loop. Unless other 
    clients have also set this option, changes by other clients will still be 
    detected through the pub/sub server. If -W is set, the -i/--interval 
    option becomes more relevant as local synchronization entirely relies on
    the interval.
    
  -a, --announce=<host>:<port>     
    Defines the hostname and the port of the pub/sub server. The pub/sub 
    server is used to notify other clients if the local client uploaded new
    data, and to get notified if other clients did so. Default is the central 
    Syncany pub/sub server at notify.syncany.org:8080. The SparkleShare 
    pub/sub server can be used interchangeably. To set up your own server,
    install a fanout instance from https://github.com/travisghansen/fanout/.
    
  -N, --no-announcements           
    Disables the pub/sub server entirely. Syncany will not connect to the 
    server and changes that are published to the pub/sub server are not 
    detected. Instead, remote changes will only be detected by the periodic
    synchronization loop. If -N is set, the -i/--interval option becomes more
    relevant as remote synchronization entirely relies on the interval.

  -i, --interval=<sec>             
    Sets the synchronization interval of the periodic 'down'/'up' loop to be
    run every <sec> seconds. The sync loop is a fallback only and is not 
    relevant if the pub/sub server and the file system watching is enabled. 
    Default value is 120 seconds.

  In addition to these options, all arguments of the commands 'status', 
  'ls-remote', 'up' and 'down' can be used.
